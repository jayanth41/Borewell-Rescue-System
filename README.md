# Borewell-Rescue-System
“An Arduino-based Borewell Rescue System designed to save children or animals trapped inside borewells using robotic mechanisms, sensors, and wireless control for safe and efficient rescue operations.”

This project presents an **Arduino-based Borewell Rescue System** designed to assist in rescuing children or animals trapped inside borewells.  
It uses **robotic mechanisms and sensors** to safely monitor and rescue without putting human lives at risk.

## Features
- Controlled robotic arm for safe rescue operations.
- Live video streaming from inside the borewell (if camera module is added).
- Ultrasonic sensor for depth measurement.
- Motor driver for robotic movement.
- Wireless control using Bluetooth / RF module.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- DC Motors / Servo Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Camera Module (ESP32 web cam)
- Bluetooth Module (HC-05)
- Power Supply
- Rescue Gripper / Arm Mechanism

## How It Works
1. The rescue robot is lowered into the borewell.  
2. Ultrasonic sensors measure depth and help navigate.  
3. A robotic arm is controlled remotely to hold the victim safely.  
4. Live camera feed helps the operator during rescue.  
5. The victim is safely lifted out of the borewell.

## Future Scope
- Adding AI-based camera for better victim detection.  
- Integration with IoT for real-time monitoring.  
- Automated emergency alerts to authorities.
